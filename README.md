#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of systematic engineering techniques to software development, design, testing, and maintenance of software systems. It makes software maintainable, scalable, and reliable, with user requirements met effectively. Software engineering is significant in the tech sector because it enables the production of quality applications that drive innovation, business processes, and digital transformation across sectors

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1950s-1960s: Software Engineering Born

The term "software engineering" was first utilized in 1968 at a NATO conference to address the "software crisis."

FORTRAN and COBOL, two of the first programming languages, were created to increase the productivity of coding.

1970s-1980s: Structured Programming and SDLC Introduction

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) was created to formalize development processes.

Structured programming techniques, such as modular design, improved software maintainability.

1990s-Present: Agile, DevOps, and AI-Driven Development

Agile practices came into existence to add flexibility to the software projects. 

DevOps practices combined development and operations to expedite deployments. 

AI and machine learning increasingly influence software automation and predictive development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement Analysis – Capturing and documenting user requirements.

Planning – Establishing the scope, budget, and schedule.

Design – Creating architectural and UI/UX designs.

Implementation (Coding) – Writing the actual software code.

Testing – Testing for functionality with various tests.

Deployment – Deploying the software to the users.

Maintenance – Providing updates and fixes.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Flexibility – Waterfall is not flexible, while Agile allows for changes at any time.
Project Structure – Waterfall follows a strict step-by-step process, whereas Agile has short development cycles with frequent updates.
Customer Involvement – Waterfall involves customers mostly at the beginning and end of the project, while Agile involves constant customer inputs.
Delivery Method – Waterfall delivers the final product at the end of the process, whereas Agile delivers working software in small, frequent installments.
Risk Management – Waterfall is riskier since errors will be realized only at the end stages of the project, while Agile minimizes risk by constant testing and inspection of features.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing

    Definition: Unit testing deals with testing individual components (functions, methods, or classes) of the software in isolation.
    Purpose: Ensures that each unit of code is right before integrating it with other components.
    Who Performs It? Developers
    Tools: Jest, Mocha, JUnit, NUnit, PyTest
    Importance:
Catches bugs early in development
        Makes code more maintainable and refactoring safe
        Saves debugging time later in the development cycle

2. Integration Testing

    Definition: Integration testing tests the interface between different components or modules to make sure that they communicate with one another as intended.
Purpose: Reveals defects in data flow, API communication, and dependencies between units.
    Who Performs It? Developers or Testers
    Types:
        Top-down: Tests top-level components first, then integrates lower-level ones.
        Bottom-up: Starts with lower-level modules and integrates higher-level components incrementally.
Big bang: All is integrated and tested together.
        Incremental: Integrate and test incrementally.
    Tools: Postman (API testing), Selenium, JUnit, TestNG
    Importance:
        Ensures different modules work together as expected
Identifies integration issues early
Helps in verifying API contracts and communication

3. System Testing

    Definition: System testing verifies the complete software system as a whole, with specified requirements.
    Purpose: Tests the entire system for functional and non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability).
Who Does It? QA Testers
    Types:
        Functional Testing: Verifies the system works as expected based on requirements.
        Performance Testing: Evaluates speed, scalability, and responsiveness.
        Security Testing: Checks vulnerabilities and data security measures.
Usability Testing: Validates user-friendliness and accessibility.
    Tools: Selenium, JMeter, LoadRunner, Appium
    Significance:
        Ensures that the system meets business and user specifications
        Discloses system-level defects
        Validates functional and non-functional software attributes

4. Acceptance Testing

Definition: Acceptance testing is the final phase of testing, verifying if the software is ready for release by meeting business and user requirements.
    Purpose: Ensures that the system is acceptable and usable by end users.
    Who Performs It? QA teams, customers, or end users
    Types:
User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Ensures the software meets real-world business needs.
        Alpha Testing: Conducted in a controlled environment before release.
        Beta Testing: Conducted by real users in a production-like environment.
    Tools: TestRail, qTest, Zephyr
    Importance:
Ensures the readiness of software for release
        Mitigates the risk of failures post-release
        Enhances user satisfaction through the integration of feedback from real users

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Prompt engineering is the set of processes involved in writing, designing, or remodeling similar conditions (input), to achieve some particular task with AI models. It prescribes the use of a clear, lucid, and concise prompt in order to assist the AI in generating meaningful and high-quality outputs. Proper prompt engineering helps toward an accurate, contextual, and meaningful interaction with AI systems.
Importance of Prompt Engineering:

More Accuracy – A well-designed prompt provides the AI model with support to give a correct and contextually located answer.
Reduces Ambiguity – A well-crafted prompt eliminates ambiguous or misleading outcomes.
Enhanced Performance – With properly tuned prompt parameters, one can avoid several rounds of revisions and iterations.
Exploit the Mind of AI-Authorship – An appropriately crafted prompt will allow an AI model to generate complicated, informative, and context-based answers.

An Example of an Unclear Prompt

 "Tell me about history."

This is an unclear and vague prompt. The AI can provide information on world history, history of ancient authority, history of any event that has occurred, etc., and it may become impossible to get desired information.

A Better Prompt

 "In less than 200 words, summarize the causes and effects of World War II."
Why Is This Prompt Better?

Direct: It addresses the topic of World War II rather than general history.
Narrowed Focus: It confines its scope to causes and effects.
Short Answer: It requires such a short answer through a concise limit on the number of words.

Those employing good prompt engineering will be able to interact and elicit responses from AI in a way that is both informative and more relevant.
